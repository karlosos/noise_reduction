## About

In this project, we are researching the possibility of noise reduction from voice signals using a deep neural network. We define the noise as sounds from computer fans, clicking on the keyboard, dog barking, or birds chirping.

Noise reduction is executed as the difference between input spectrogram and predicted noise spectrogram. We will predict noise spectrogram using CNN. U-Net was chosen as a backbone as we found that it was successfully used in [Singing Voice Separation with Deep U-Net Convolutional Networks](https://ejhumphrey.com/assets/pdf/jansson2017singing.pdf).

Voice signals are available at [LibriSpeech](http://www.openslr.org/12/). LibriSpeech is a corpus of approximately 1000 hours of 16kHz read English speech, prepared by Vassil Panayotov with the assistance of Daniel Povey. The data is derived from read audiobooks from the LibriVox project. Noise signals were collected from [ESC-50 dataset](https://github.com/karolpiczak/ESC-50). The ESC-50 dataset is a labeled collection of 2000 environmental audio recordings suitable for benchmarking methods of environmental sound classification.

## Development

Clone repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/karlosos/noise_reduction 
cd noise_reduction
```

Create virtual environment, e.g. with `virtualenv`:

```
python -m virtualenv .venv
./venv/Script/activate
```

Install requirements:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Data preparation

Data was downloaded using Google Colab notebook that is available in `./notebooks/download_data.ipynb` or [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1pHQtifx5qlcXN34fEFxfluW4m2D8nM2x?usp=sharing). You can download prepared data [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-3XTuOUfU_xkgXZJgMrc4QZ_-ElvNrjs/view?usp=sharing) for development consisting of `dev-clean.tar.gz` (development set from LibriSpeech) and noises from ESC-50 from 3 categories (keyboard typing, mouse clicking, birds chirping).
Place `data/` folder into root of this repository.
